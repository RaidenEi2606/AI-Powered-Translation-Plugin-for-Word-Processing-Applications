**RaidenNLLB** is a powerful Python plugin that brings multilingual translation directly into your Word documents.

The plugin also offers flexible configuration options, allowing users to tailor translation behavior to their specific needs.

   This command installs webpack and webpack-cli as development dependencies in your project.
   

## Notice: You have to notice those condition below to make sure application runs:

**1.** When run file if you facing error you should open full folder in you IDE for making sure file reading is success
   Folder structure in your IDE should be like this:
         EX2
         |---RaidenEi
             |--- (other files)
         |---README.md
         |---Model
             |--- trans.py

**2.** You have to trust (in case the window pop up to asking for trusting the source) or else it won't run.

**3.** In case the facebook/nllb-200-1.3B model is too large (around 5.84GB) or if any installation issues arise that could affect the evaluation process, I have recorded a demo showcasing the implemented features to facilitate the assessment by the instructors.
